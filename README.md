Django Banish Plus
====
**Django Banish Plus** is a Django *middleware* app to banish *user agents by IP address* or *User Agent Header*.
It also supports basic abuse prevention by automatically banning users if they **exceed a certain number of requests per minute**, which is likely some form of attack or attempted *denial of service*.

Django Banish Plus stores all ***banishments*** in memory to avoid database lookups on every request. 
It requires memcached, especially for the IP abuse monitoring feature.

Django Banish Plus is based on [Django Banish](http://github.com/yourabi/django-banish) package by [Yousef Ourabi][1].

Features
----------

1. Banish requests, by **IP** or **user agent header** included blacklist.
2. Avoid banish request by whitelist.
3. Banish request from TOR network, using TOR IPS database.
4. The banish action is configurable, (403 response, redirect or custom template).
